Based on the data that was created on the Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart, the "successful" is clear that it had it's increases and decreases.  May having the best fund raising performances follwoed by June in 2nd and July coming in 3rd.  Many of the plays were successful do to reaching their Pledges on their fund raising Outcomes.  Many plays met thier Pledges by very little amounts of money.  I was not impressed on the amounts of money raised to meet the Pledges.  Some plays did pass the $1000 mark but that was a very small number of plays.  On the "failed" plays I thought the goal amounts were very high on what were the expectations.  The majority on the plays did not even get near thier Pledged.  "Canceled" plays were not too many.  In my opinion the "failed" plays should of been canceled instead giving them a "failed" label.

By looking at the Kickstater file and the names of the plays, some plays had many interesting titles and others had not so great titles.  Going through this file, many of the theater fans in my opinion pick the most popular plays verses the other plays that did not performed well.  Word of mouth, maybe some audience members did not like something about the play and posted it in one of their social  media platforms to express their opions on how well the characters performed and how awfull their performance was.  I believe the power of word of mouth and social media sharing is changing how retail, movies, and the theater arts do well and others not so well.  Consumers have a very powerful saying on where they spent thier hard earning money.  Out of the 650(just guessing the number) of plays the "successful" ones performed well compared to the "failed' ones.
